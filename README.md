- 👋 Hi, I’m @zentree
- 👀 I’m interested in statistics and mathematical models of natural resources, particularly trees.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning more stats. I should revisit some of the Bayesian work I was doing a few years ago. Coding? mostly in R.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on... haven't decide about this one, yet.
- 📫 How to reach me: easiest @zentree in Twitter.
