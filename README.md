- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @zentree
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in statistics and mathematical models of natural resources, particularly trees.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently figuring out how to use GitHub. Just moved my Wordpress blog to a static blog here:
[Palimpsest](https://luis.apiolaza.net/2024/12/30/paring-down/). Coding? mostly in R.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: easiest is in Mastodon [ojala@mastodon.nz](https://mastodon.nz/@ojala) or, slower, @zentree in Twitter.
